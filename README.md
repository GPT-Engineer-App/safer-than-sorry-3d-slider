# safer-than-sorry-3d-slider

I want you to create me a website. The Title of the website is called Safer Than Sorry Then I want like a 3D slider that slides through 3 buttons or pages (You choos) I want the 1st one to be "Get a Quote" there I want a life insurance tool kit so people can see the cost of how much their life insurance policy would be based on gender height and weight. Then next slider or button depending on what you choose I want a button called "Self Apply" you can leave that page blank for now Ill edit it than the last one "Schedule Appointment" only thing I need on that page is a calendar. For the overall website I want it to be very 3D animated but appropiate colors and images because it is a website for people that want life insurance.
